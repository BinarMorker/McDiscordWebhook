# McDiscordWebhook

Connects a minecraft server to discord using discord webhooks. Everytime someone joins/leaves the server starts/stops or someone sends a message, it is sent in the discord channel where the webhook was created.

The webhook url must be set in the config (the `mcdiscwbhk.properties` file) which is generated on first server start.
